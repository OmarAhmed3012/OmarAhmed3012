## 2025 Snapshot
- Leading backend modernization at **Caelum Group**—orchestrating deployments with GitHub Actions and GCP Cloud Build, keeping releases under **8 minutes** end-to-end.
- Owning privacy-first **video processing services** (Python + GCP VM) that deliver automated blurring and voice alteration for enterprise media workflows.
- Scaling a modular **NestJS + PostgreSQL** platform with infrastructure-as-code via **Pulumi**, improving reliability across multi-tenant environments.

---

## What I Solve
- **Platform Architecture:** Shape modular monoliths and microservices with clear domain boundaries and event-driven patterns.
- **Developer Velocity:** Design CI/CD pipelines, observability, and infrastructure automation that keep teams shipping confidently.
- **Data & Messaging:** Model mission-critical data flows across PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.
- **API Engineering:** Ship TypeScript/Node.js services that balance performance, security, and maintainability.

---

## Recent Wins
- Cut Caelum Group’s Docker image build time from 3 hours to **sub-8-minute** deployments by rebuilding the pipeline around GitHub Actions and Cloud Build.
- Rolled out a production **video privacy pipeline** combining Python, FFmpeg, and GCP to meet broadcast compliance requirements.
- Launched shared **TypeScript service templates** and NPM packages to accelerate new service spin-up across teams.
- Delivered event-driven inventory and order flows with **Kafka** during my time at Rabbit, improving operational transparency.
